						<h3>Additional Support</h3>
						<p>At the end of your life or the life of a loved one, you may want additional support or services outside of what we provide at End of Life Guides Marquette: a healing massage, beautiful flowers for your bedside, or a handcrafted urn for your ashes. While we cannot provide these services ourselves, we can recommend skilled professionals in the Marquette area who specialize in these areas. Below is a list of some of the providers, businesses, and organizations that we regularly work with and recommend to our clients.</p>

										<dt>Ann Russ Ceramics</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In my studio, I craft ceramic vessels to honor the preciousness of life. Each memorial urn, reliquary, and Spirit bowl is hand-built with care, reflecting life’s sacred transitions. My work is inspired by wonder, gratitude for life’s mysteries, and the quiet beauty of nature.</p>
											<p>I believe in offering people something handmade with heart and intention—an alternative to mass-produced pieces that lack human touch.</p>
											<p>If you're looking for something truly meaningful, I’d love to create a special piece with you. Feel free to reach out or explore my gallery - many pieces are available, and if not, I’d be happy to craft something similar in spirit just for you...</p>
