							<h1>Who We Are</h1>
							<p>"There are no quick fixes to grief. No easy answers. Every expression of grief that wants to be felt and honored and given its space, must be allowed... in order to heal." -Tom Zuba</p>

						<p>Jennifer Aldrich-Boyle and Kathy Anthony, two friends trained as Death Doulas to support those dying and their families in the Marquette area. They aim to change the stigma attached to talking about dying.
						</p>
						<p>Many times we live our lives without really being present and we miss the everyday beautiful moments, or we miss really connecting with others, or even connecting with ourselves. We often don’t talk about what we want the end of our life to look like with our loved ones, so our loved ones end up with regrets about what they did or didn’t do, or the dying person doesn’t die in the manner they wished to.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, there are often conflicts within the family because the family doesn’t know what their dying loved ones' wishes are, or family members don’t agree on what should happen if their loved one didn’t leave instructions. </p>
						<p>These are things we can change and work on by talking openly about death so that we don’t have such difficulties at the end of life when it would be ideal if everything were peaceful.</p>

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jennifer-aldrich-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Jennifer Aldrich smiling in front of a stone wall" /></span><i class="">How would you live your life differently if you were just given a diagnosis that gave you a week, month, or year to live?</i></p>
						<p>I help guide people to find their space and peace within, while being present and accepting of whatever comes up.
						</p>
						<p>We all touch lives and have our lives touched in some ways while here on Earth, both positively and negatively. While most of us want to leave this earthly realm in peace and without regrets, many of us may not know how to achieve this. Would you be surprised to know that we all have the answers within, we just have to learn how to listen? 
						</p>
						<p>I offer compassionate, non-judgmental space, as well as educational, spiritual, and emotional support and advocacy to those in palliative care and hospice, and their families, as they navigate all aspects of the end of their lives. I aim to help all achieve a “good death”, to the extent that one can control this.</p>
						<p>I have a BS in community health education, an IHAP diploma (integrative healing arts practitioner), a CH (certified hypnotherapist), and have completed death and dying trainings.
						</p>
						<p>I offer services as a death doula/end-of-life guide. I offer hypno-coaching, (a combination session utilizing the healing effects of both transpersonal hypnotherapy and coaching together) which can help clients work through stuck emotions and old stories that we tell ourselves, help us break addictions or behaviors that no longer work for us, help us come to a place of peace and acceptance within and to focus on the present moment.  I am ordained and offer inclusive ceremonies and blessings.</p>
