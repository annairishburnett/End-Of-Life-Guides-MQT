					<h3>Our Offerings</h3>
					<p>A Death Doula is different from Hospice because the focus is on emotional needs and spiritual support, rather than medical needs. We are advocates for the dying, ready to honor their path, hold space for emotions, and provide compassionate companionship at the end of life.</p>
								<dl>
									<dt>Graceful Transitioning Consultation</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>During this consulation, we offer space to discuss your desires, goals, and the path forward for death doula care at the end of your life. Together, we will explore the emotional and spiritual aspects of the dying process, ensuring that your needs and wishes are honored. We will also address any logistical concerns, such as burial options and advanced directives, allowing you and your family to focus on what truly matters—creating a meaningful, peaceful, and compassionate experience. As advocates, we will help guide you and your loved ones through this journey, ensuring that the transition is handled with dignity, understanding, and support.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>End-of-Life Doula Care</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>End-of-life doula care provides compassionate, personalized support for those who are dying, ensuring their transition is met with dignity, understanding, and peace. Doulas act as advocates, honoring the individual’s unique journey while helping explore possibilities for a meaningful and peaceful passing. They focus on the emotional and spiritual aspects of the dying process, offering space for reflection and supporting the person in processing their feelings and any spiritual concerns. Doulas also hold space for both the dying person and their family, offering a neutral sounding board for all emotions and providing comfort through healing touch and visualization techniques. They help explore the loved one’s life, creating ceremonies tailored to their needs, and assist in planning Life Celebration gatherings, whether before or after death. When the dying process begins, doulas initiate and oversee the Vigil Plan, ensuring it aligns with the family’s vision. They provide in-person support at the time of death, acting as a point person with hospice and the funeral home, and offer grief support by gathering with the family afterward to reprocess and assist in navigating the mourning process.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Family Doula Care</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>A Death Doula provides compassionate and creative support for families navigating the end-of-life journey alongside their loved one. By holding space for emotions, they help family members process grief, fears, and the spiritual aspects of death in a supportive and understanding way. In addition to emotional care for the family, we offer guidance on burial options, logistics, and what to do when death occurs. This holistic approach ensures that both the individual and their loved ones feel supported, informed, and cared for throughout the process.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Logistical Support</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>This option provides essential logistical support to help individuals and families navigate end-of-life arrangements with clarity and ease. This includes exploring burial options, coordinating logistics, and offering guidance on what steps to take when a loved one passes. Doulas also assist with preplanning, much like a funeral home, by helping individuals document their wishes, choose service providers, and ensure that advanced directives are in place. By addressing these details in advance, families can focus on being present with their loved ones rather than worrying about logistical challenges.</p>

					<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
					<p>At the end of your life or the life of a loved one, you may want additional support or services outside of what we provide at End of Life Guides Marquette. A healing massage, a beautiful handcrafted urn for your ashes, or an alternative funeral service for when you are gone. While we cannot provide these services ourselves, we can recommend skilled professionals in the Marquette area who specialize in this areas.
